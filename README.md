A curated collection of **machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch** in Python. This repository is designed for educational purposes to help learners understand the core mechanics of popular ML algorithms.

## üìå Features
- **Clean, modular code** with detailed comments.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for visual explanations and step-by-step execution.
- **Datasets** included for testing and experimentation.
- **Mathematical derivations** of algorithms in notebooks.
